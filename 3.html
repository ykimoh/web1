  <p>I am a <strong>self-motivated <u><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/young-kim-designer/" target="_blank" title="Go to LinkedIn">designer</a></u></strong> who works ambitiously on goals and thrives in a fast-paced environment. I am also keen to take on responsibility, willing to learn and grow with a company.</p>
  <p>I worked for 2 years as a UX and UI designer at a start-up incubator in Korea, designing wireframes, prototypes, and graphic assets for diverse businesses. At FXGear, an AR/VR tech company, I created multiple interfaces for AR kiosk, VR headset, websites, and mobile and PC applications for the next 2 years. Currently, I am working as a freelance designer, based in Greater Chicago Area.</p>
